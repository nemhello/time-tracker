# Update - Single Global Search Only

## Change Made:

✓ Removed the category-specific search bar
✓ Only ONE search bar in the entire app - the global one on the main page

## How It Works Now:

**Main Page:**
- Global search bar at top (searches all 92 locations)
- 10 category buttons below

**After Selecting Category:**
- Back button
- All locations in that category listed (no search)
- If you need to search, go back and use global search

## Why This Is Better:

- Cleaner interface
- One search to rule them all
- Less confusing - just one place to search
- Categories show everything at a glance

## Files to Update:

Download these 2 files:
- [app.js](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/app.js)
- [index.html](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/index.html)

(styles.css and locations.js unchanged from last update)

## Using GitHub Desktop:

1. Replace these 2 files
2. Commit: "Single global search only"
3. Push origin
4. Done!

Everything else (email workflow, location details, 10 categories) stays the same.
